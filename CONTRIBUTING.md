# For contributors
This project uses **P**lugin **O**riented **P**rogramming paradigm by
incorporating [SaltStack pop library]

I decided to use classic `forking flow` model which is nicely described here:
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow


## TL;DR:
0. create an issue (with nice description *por favor*)
1. fork the repo and `git clone` your fork
2. then create your own branch (e.g. `feature/STH` or `bugfix/STH`) - keep `STH`
   short, commit messages are for details:
```
git checkout -b feature/more-ebuild-details
```
3. after changes do the PR into the `master` branch
